I've implemented a few patterns with a focus on the data / data access technology as described in the requirements. I've built the ability to list the albums with pagination as well as add, remove and edit the records.

If I were to continue I would get a bit deeper on the tests as testing the data layers is generally complicated I have some some basic tests just to illustrate that I would add tests. 

I also started to expand out the entities so we could have things be more relational however to stop the test becoming too complicated I opted for a simple album entity using basic types.
